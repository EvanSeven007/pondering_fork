//! Piece-Square Tables (PSTs).
//!
//! A PST is a table with an item for each piece at each square.
//! It grants a fixed value to the evaluation of a position for each piece,
//! granting benefits for being on "good" squares and penalties for pieces on
//! "bad" ones.
//! For instance, a knight is much more valuable near the center, so the PST
//! value for a knight on rank 4 and file 3 is positive.
